		<p>With aspirations to become the best bodybuilder in the world, Vitaliy Ugolnikov, popularly known as ‘Good Vito’ is moving to Brazil to further his quest. After making the move to a new country, ‘Good Vito’ intends to improve his physique while training in the offseason.</p>

		<p>Ugolnikov’s time competing in the IFBB Pro Elite league triggered curiosity as many wondered when he might make the transition into a new competitive landscape. In Dec. 2021, he switched to NPC bodybuilding with the intention of one day earning his Pro card to compete in the IFBB Pro League.</p>

		<p>Ugolnikov’s size and proportions are some of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy9lNoOL060">strongest assets</a>, and given his young age, ‘Good Vito’ appears to be one of the more promising prospects in the sport. Being a successful bodybuilder takes</p>
		<ul>
			<li>an incredible physique</li>
			<li>proper training</li>
			<li>and a well-monitored diet</li>
		</ul>
		<p>in order to reach the top of the sport.</p> 

		<p>Muscle mass and an aesthetic physique aren’t the only characteristics important to winning a bodybuilding show. Effective posing and impressing the judges are paramount factors essential to earning a first place trophy. Of course, performing outside of comfort zones play a role, and ‘Good Vito’ is embracing that challenge head-on. With his recent move to Brazil, Ugolnikov is starting anew and plans to bring a whole new look to his next sanctioned competition.</p>
